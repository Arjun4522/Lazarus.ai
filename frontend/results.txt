Name: CVE-2022-41874
Description: Tauri is a framework for building binaries for all major desktop platforms. In versions prior to 1.0.7 and 1.1.2, Tauri is vulnerable to an Incorrectly-Resolved Name. Due to incorrect escaping of special characters in paths selected via the file dialog and drag and drop functionality, it is possible to partially bypass the `fs` scope definition. It is not possible to traverse into arbitrary paths, as the issue is limited to neighboring files and sub folders of already allowed paths. The impact differs on Windows, MacOS and Linux due to different specifications of valid path characters. This bypass depends on the file picker dialog or dragged files, as user selected paths are automatically added to the allow list at runtime. A successful bypass requires the user to select a pre-existing malicious file or directory during the file picker dialog and an adversary controlled logic to access these files. The issue has been patched in versions 1.0.7, 1.1.2 and 1.2.0. As a workaround, disable the dialog and fileDropEnabled component inside the tauri.conf.json.

Name: CVE-2020-3110
Description: A vulnerability in the Cisco Discovery Protocol implementation for the Cisco Video Surveillance 8000 Series IP Cameras could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to execute code remotely or cause a reload of an affected IP Camera. The vulnerability is due to missing checks when processing Cisco Discovery Protocol messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious Cisco Discovery Protocol packet to the targeted IP Camera. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to expose the affected IP Camera for remote code execution or cause it to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. Cisco Discovery Protocol is a Layer 2 protocol. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be in the same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent). This vulnerability is fixed in Video Surveillance 8000 Series IP Camera Firmware Release 1.0.7 and later.

Name: CVE-2020-26230
Description: Radar COVID is the official COVID-19 exposure notification app for Spain. In affected versions of Radar COVID, identification and de-anonymization of COVID-19 positive users that upload Radar COVID TEKs to the Radar COVID server is possible. This vulnerability enables the identification and de-anonymization of COVID-19 positive users when using Radar COVID. The vulnerability is caused by the fact that Radar COVID connections to the server (uploading of TEKs to the backend) are only made by COVID-19 positives. Therefore, any on-path observer with the ability to monitor traffic between the app and the server can identify which users had a positive test. Such an adversary can be the mobile network operator (MNO) if the connection is done through a mobile network, the Internet Service Provider (ISP) if the connection is done through the Internet (e.g., a home network), a VPN provider used by the user, the local network operator in the case of enterprise networks, or any eavesdropper with access to the same network (WiFi or Ethernet) as the user as could be the case of public WiFi hotspots deployed at shopping centers, airports, hotels, and coffee shops. The attacker may also de-anonymize the user. For this additional stage to succeed, the adversary needs to correlate Radar COVID traffic to other identifiable information from the victim. This could be achieved by associating the connection to a contract with the name of the victim or by associating Radar COVID traffic to other user-generated flows containing identifiers in the clear (e.g., HTTP cookies or other mobile flows sending unique identifiers like the IMEI or the AAID without encryption). The former can be executed, for instance, by the Internet Service Provider or the MNO. The latter can be executed by any on-path adversary, such as the network provider or even the cloud provider that hosts more than one service accessed by the victim. The farther the adversary is either from the victim (the client) or the end-point (the server), the less likely it may be that the adversary has access to re-identification information. The vulnerability has been mitigated with the injection of dummy traffic from the application to the backend. Dummy traffic is generated by all users independently of whether they are COVID-19 positive or not. The issue was fixed in iOS in version 1.0.8 (uniform distribution), 1.1.0 (exponential distribution), Android in version 1.0.7 (uniform distribution), 1.1.0 (exponential distribution), Backend in version 1.1.2-RELEASE. For more information see the referenced GitHub Security Advisory.

This vulnerability affects Mozilla VPN iOS 1.0.7 < (929), Mozilla VPN Windows < 1.2.2, and Mozilla VPN Android 1.1.0 < (1360).

Name: CVE-2020-15135
Description: save-server (npm package) before version 1.05 is affected by a CSRF vulnerability, as there is no CSRF mitigation (Tokens etc.). The fix introduced in version version 1.05 unintentionally breaks uploading so version v1.0.7 is the fixed version. This is patched by implementing Double submit. The CSRF attack would require you to navigate to a malicious site while you have an active session with Save-Server (Session key stored in cookies). The malicious user would then be able to perform some actions, including uploading/deleting files and adding redirects. If you are logged in as root, this attack is significantly more severe. They can in addition create, delete and update users. If they updated the password of a user, that user's files would then be available. If the root password is updated, all files would be visible if they logged in with the new password. Note that due to the same origin policy malicious actors cannot view the gallery or the response of any of the methods, nor be sure they succeeded. This issue has been patched in version 1.0.7.

Description: dd-trace-cpp is the Datadog distributed tracing for C++. When the library fails to extract trace context due to malformed unicode, it logs the list of audited headers and their values using the `nlohmann` JSON library.

Name: CVE-2024-28181
Description: turbo_boost-commands is a set of commands to help you build robust reactive applications with Rails & Hotwire. TurboBoost Commands has existing protections in place to guarantee that only public methods on Command classes can be invoked; however, the existing checks aren't as robust as they should be. It's possible for a sophisticated attacker to invoke more methods than should be permitted depending on the the strictness of authorization checks that individual applications enforce. Being able to call some of these methods can have security implications. Commands verify that the class must be a `Command` and that the method requested is defined as a public method; however, this isn't robust enough to guard against all unwanted code execution. The library should more strictly enforce which methods are considered safe before allowing them to be executed. This issue has been addressed in versions 0.1.3, and 0.2.2. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should see the repository GHSA for workaround advice.

Name: CVE-2024-4603
Description: Issue summary: Checking excessively long DSA keys or parameters may be very slow. Impact summary: Applications that use the functions EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() to check a DSA public key or DSA parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service. The functions EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() perform various checks on DSA parameters. Some of those computations take a long time if the modulus (`p` parameter) is too large. Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not allow using public keys with a modulus which is over 10,000 bits in length for signature verification. However the key and parameter check functions do not limit the modulus size when performing the checks. An application that calls EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack. These functions are not called by OpenSSL itself on untrusted DSA keys so only applications that directly call these functions may be vulnerable. Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey and pkeyparam command line applications when using the `-check` option. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue. The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are affected by this issue.

Name: CVE-2024-37168
Description: @grpc/grps-js implements the core functionality of gRPC purely in JavaScript, without a C++ addon. Prior to versions 1.10.9, 1.9.15, and 1.8.22, there are two separate code paths in which memory can be allocated per message in excess of the `grpc.max_receive_message_length` channel option: If an incoming message has a size on the wire greater than the configured limit, the entire message is buffered before it is discarded; and/or if an incoming message has a size within the limit on the wire but decompresses to a size greater than the limit, the entire message is decompressed into memory, and on the server is not discarded. This has been patched in versions 1.10.9, 1.9.15, and 1.8.22.

Name: CVE-2024-37031
Description: The Active Admin (aka activeadmin) framework before 3.2.2 for Ruby on Rails allows stored XSS in certain situations where users can create entities (to be later edited in forms) with arbitrary names, aka a "dynamic form legends" issue. 4.0.0.beta7 is also a fixed version.

Name: CVE-2024-35223
Description: Dapr is a portable, event-driven, runtime for building distributed applications across cloud and edge. Dapr sends the app token of the invoker app instead of the app token of the invoked app. This causes of a leak of the application token of the invoker app to the invoked app when using Dapr as a gRPC proxy for remote service invocation. This vulnerability impacts Dapr users who use Dapr as a gRPC proxy for remote service invocation as well as the Dapr App API token functionality. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain access to the app token of the invoker app, potentially compromising security and authentication mechanisms. This vulnerability was patched in version 1.13.3.

Name: CVE-2024-32962
Description: xml-crypto is an xml digital signature and encryption library for Node.js. In affected versions the default configuration does not check authorization of the signer, it only checks the validity of the signature per section 3.2.2 of the w3 xmldsig-core-20080610 spec. As such, without additional validation steps, the default configuration allows a malicious actor to re-sign an XML document, place the certificate in a `<KeyInfo />` element, and pass `xml-crypto` default validation checks. As a result `xml-crypto` trusts by default any certificate provided via digitally signed XML document's `<KeyInfo />`. `xml-crypto` prefers to use any certificate provided via digitally signed XML document's `<KeyInfo />` even if library was configured to use specific certificate (`publicCert`) for signature verification purposes. An attacker can spoof signature verification by modifying XML document and replacing existing signature with signature generated with malicious private key (created by attacker) and by attaching that private key's certificate to `<KeyInfo />` element. This vulnerability is combination of changes introduced to `4.0.0` on pull request 301 / commit `c2b83f98` and has been addressed in version 6.0.0 with pull request 445 / commit `21201723d`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may either check the certificate extracted via `getCertFromKeyInfo` against trusted certificates before accepting the results of the validation or set `xml-crypto's getCertFromKeyInfo` to `() => undefined` forcing `xml-crypto` to use an explicitly configured `publicCert` or `privateKey` for signature verification.

Name: CVE-2024-29834
Description: This vulnerability allows authenticated users with produce or consume permissions to perform unauthorized operations on partitioned topics, such as unloading topics and triggering compaction. These management operations should be restricted to users with the tenant admin role or superuser role. An authenticated user with produce permission can create subscriptions and update subscription properties on partitioned topics, even though this should be limited to users with consume permissions. This impact analysis assumes that Pulsar has been configured with the default authorization provider. For custom authorization providers, the impact could be slightly different. Additionally, the vulnerability allows an authenticated user to read, create, modify, and delete namespace properties in any namespace in any tenant. In Pulsar, namespace properties are reserved for user provided metadata about the namespace. This issue affects Apache Pulsar versions from 2.7.1 to 2.10.6, from 2.11.0 to 2.11.4, from 3.0.0 to 3.0.3, from 3.1.0 to 3.1.3, and from 3.2.0 to 3.2.1. 3.0 Apache Pulsar users should upgrade to at least 3.0.4. 3.1 and 3.2 Apache Pulsar users should upgrade to at least 3.2.2. Users operating versions prior to those listed above should upgrade to the aforementioned patched versions or newer versions.

Name: CVE-2024-2511
Description: Issue summary: Some non-default TLS server configurations can cause unbounded memory growth when processing TLSv1.3 sessions Impact summary: An attacker may exploit certain server configurations to trigger unbounded memory growth that would lead to a Denial of Service This problem can occur in TLSv1.3 if the non-default SSL_OP_NO_TICKET option is being used (but not if early_data support is also configured and the default anti-replay protection is in use). In this case, under certain conditions, the session cache can get into an incorrect state and it will fail to flush properly as it fills. The session cache will continue to grow in an unbounded manner. A malicious client could deliberately create the scenario for this failure to force a Denial of Service. It may also happen by accident in normal operation. This issue only affects TLS servers supporting TLSv1.3. It does not affect TLS clients. The FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is also not affected by this issue.

Name: CVE-2023-33953
Description: gRPC contains a vulnerability that allows hpack table accounting errors could lead to unwanted disconnects between clients and servers in exceptional cases/ Three vectors were found that allow the following DOS attacks: - Unbounded memory buffering in the HPACK parser - Unbounded CPU consumption in the HPACK parser The unbounded CPU consumption is down to a copy that occurred per-input-block in the parser, and because that could be unbounded due to the memory copy bug we end up with an O(n^2) parsing loop, with n selected by the client. The unbounded memory buffering bugs: - The header size limit check was behind the string reading code, so we needed to first buffer up to a 4 gigabyte string before rejecting it as longer than 8 or 16kb. - HPACK varints have an encoding quirk whereby an infinite number of 0&#8217;s can be added at the start of an integer. gRPC&#8217;s hpack parser needed to read all of them before concluding a parse. - gRPC&#8217;s metadata overflow check was performed per frame, so that the following sequence of frames could cause infinite buffering: HEADERS: containing a: 1 CONTINUATION: containing a: 2 CONTINUATION: containing a: 3 etc&#8230;

Name: CVE-2023-32732
Description: gRPC contains a vulnerability whereby a client can cause a termination of connection between a HTTP2 proxy and a gRPC server: a base64 encoding error for `-bin` suffixed headers will result in a disconnection by the gRPC server, but is typically allowed by HTTP2 proxies. We recommend upgrading beyond the commit in https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/32309 https://www.google.com/url

Name: CVE-2023-32731
Description: When gRPC HTTP2 stack raised a header size exceeded error, it skipped parsing the rest of the HPACK frame. This caused any HPACK table mutations to also be skipped, resulting in a desynchronization of HPACK tables between sender and receiver. If leveraged, say, between a proxy and a backend, this could lead to requests from the proxy being interpreted as containing headers from different proxy clients - leading to an information leak that can be used for privilege escalation or data exfiltration. We recommend upgrading beyond the commit contained in https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/33005 https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/33005

Name: CVE-2023-30845
Description: ESPv2 is a service proxy that provides API management capabilities using Google Service Infrastructure. ESPv2 2.20.0 through 2.42.0 contains an authentication bypass vulnerability. API clients can craft a malicious `X-HTTP-Method-Override` header value to bypass JWT authentication in specific cases. ESPv2 allows malicious requests to bypass authentication if both the conditions are true: The requested HTTP method is **not** in the API service definition (OpenAPI spec or gRPC `google.api.http` proto annotations, and the specified `X-HTTP-Method-Override` is a valid HTTP method in the API service definition. ESPv2 will forward the request to your backend without checking the JWT. Attackers can craft requests with a malicious `X-HTTP-Method-Override` value that allows them to bypass specifying JWTs. Restricting API access with API keys works as intended and is not affected by this vulnerability. Upgrade deployments to release v2.43.0 or higher to receive a patch. This release ensures that JWT authentication occurs, even when the caller specifies `x-http-method-override`. `x-http-method-override` is still supported by v2.43.0+. API clients can continue sending this header to ESPv2.

Name: CVE-2023-29193
Description: SpiceDB is an open source, Google Zanzibar-inspired, database system for creating and managing security-critical application permissions. The `spicedb serve` command contains a flag named `--grpc-preshared-key` which is used to protect the gRPC API from being accessed by unauthorized requests. The values of this flag are to be considered sensitive, secret data. The `/debug/pprof/cmdline` endpoint served by the metrics service (defaulting running on port `9090`) reveals the command-line flags provided for debugging purposes. If a password is set via the `--grpc-preshared-key` then the key is revealed by this endpoint along with any other flags provided to the SpiceDB binary. This issue has been fixed in version 1.19.1. ### Impact All deployments abiding by the recommended best practices for production usage are **NOT affected**: - Authzed's SpiceDB Serverless - Authzed's SpiceDB Dedicated - SpiceDB Operator Users configuring SpiceDB via environment variables are **NOT affected**. Users **MAY be affected** if they expose their metrics port to an untrusted network and are configuring `--grpc-preshared-key` via command-line flag. ### Patches TODO ### Workarounds To workaround this issue you can do one of the following: - Configure the preshared key via an environment variable (e.g. `SPICEDB_GRPC_PRESHARED_KEY=yoursecret spicedb serve`) - Reconfigure the `--metrics-addr` flag to bind to a trusted network (e.g. `--metrics-addr=localhost:9090`) - Disable the metrics service via the flag (e.g. `--metrics-enabled=false`) - Adopt one of the recommended deployment models: [Authzed's managed services](https://authzed.com/pricing) or the [SpiceDB Operator](https://github.com/authzed/spicedb-operator) ### References - [GitHub Security Advisory issued for SpiceDB](https://github.com/authzed/spicedb/security/advisories/GHSA-cjr9-mr35-7xh6) - [Go issue #22085](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/22085) for documenting the risks of exposing pprof to the internet - [Go issue #42834](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/42834) discusses preventing pprof registration to the default serve mux - [semgrep rule go.lang.security.audit.net.pprof.pprof-debug-exposure](https://semgrep.dev/r?q=go.lang.security.audit.net.pprof) checks for a variation of this issue ### Credit We'd like to thank Amit Laish, a security researcher at GE Vernova for responsibly disclosing this vulnerability.

Description: Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy designed for cloud-native applications. Prior to versions 1.26.0, 1.25.3, 1.24.4, 1.23.6, and 1.22.9, escalation of privileges is possible when `failure_mode_allow: true` is configured for `ext_authz` filter. For affected components that are used for logging and/or visibility, requests may not be logged by the receiving service. When Envoy was configured to use ext_authz, ext_proc, tap, ratelimit filters, and grpc access log service and an http header with non-UTF-8 data was received, Envoy would generate an invalid protobuf message and send it to the configured service. The receiving service would typically generate an error when decoding the protobuf message. For ext_authz that was configured with ``failure_mode_allow: true``, the request would have been allowed in this case. For the other services, this could have resulted in other unforeseen errors such as a lack of visibility into requests. As of versions 1.26.0, 1.25.3, 1.24.4, 1.23.6, and 1.22.9, Envoy by default sanitizes the values sent in gRPC service calls to be valid UTF-8, replacing data that is not valid UTF-8 with a `!` character. This behavioral change can be temporarily reverted by setting runtime guard `envoy.reloadable_features.service_sanitize_non_utf8_strings` to false. As a workaround, one may set `failure_mode_allow: false` for `ext_authz`.

Name: CVE-2023-27487
Description: Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy designed for cloud-native applications. Prior to versions 1.26.0, 1.25.3, 1.24.4, 1.23.6, and 1.22.9, the client may bypass JSON Web Token (JWT) checks and forge fake original paths. The header `x-envoy-original-path` should be an internal header, but Envoy does not remove this header from the request at the beginning of request processing when it is sent from an untrusted client. The faked header would then be used for trace logs and grpc logs, as well as used in the URL used for `jwt_authn` checks if the `jwt_authn` filter is used, and any other upstream use of the x-envoy-original-path header. Attackers may forge a trusted `x-envoy-original-path` header. Versions 1.26.0, 1.25.3, 1.24.4, 1.23.6, and 1.22.9 have patches for this issue.

Name: CVE-2023-25491
Description: Auth. (admin+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Samuel Marshall JCH Optimize plugin <= 3.2.2 versions.

Name: CVE-2023-23119
Description: The use of the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) algorithm for integrity check during firmware update makes Ubiquiti airFiber AF2X Radio firmware version 3.2.2 and earlier vulnerable to firmware modification attacks. An attacker can conduct a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack to modify the new firmware image and bypass the checksum verification.

Name: CVE-2023-1428
Description: There exists an vulnerability causing an abort() to be called in gRPC. The following headers cause gRPC's C++ implementation to abort() when called via http2: te: x (x != trailers) :scheme: x (x != http, https) grpclb_client_stats: x (x == anything) On top of sending one of those headers, a later header must be sent that gets the total header size past 8KB. We recommend upgrading past git commit 2485fa94bd8a723e5c977d55a3ce10b301b437f8 or v1.53 and above.

Name: CVE-2023-0377
Description: The Scriptless Social Sharing WordPress plugin before 3.2.2 does not validate and escape some of its block options before outputting them back in a page/post where the block is embed, which could allow users with the contributor role and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

Name: CVE-2023-0296
Description: The Birthday attack against 64-bit block ciphers flaw (CVE-2016-2183) was reported for the health checks port (9979) on etcd grpc-proxy component. Even though the CVE-2016-2183 has been fixed in the etcd components, to enable periodic health checks from kubelet, it was necessary to open up a new port (9979) on etcd grpc-proxy, hence this port might be considered as still vulnerable to the same type of vulnerability. The health checks on etcd grpc-proxy do not contain sensitive data (only metrics data), therefore the potential impact related to this vulnerability is minimal. The CVE-2023-0296 has been assigned to this issue to track the permanent fix in the etcd component.

Name: CVE-2022-39958
Description: The OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) is affected by a response body bypass to sequentially exfiltrate small and undetectable sections of data by repeatedly submitting an HTTP Range header field with a small byte range. A restricted resource, access to which would ordinarily be detected, may be exfiltrated from the backend, despite being protected by a web application firewall that uses CRS. Short subsections of a restricted resource may bypass pattern matching techniques and allow undetected access. The legacy CRS versions 3.0.x and 3.1.x are affected, as well as the currently supported versions 3.2.1 and 3.3.2. Integrators and users are advised to upgrade to 3.2.2 and 3.3.3 respectively and to configure a CRS paranoia level of 3 or higher.

Name: CVE-2022-39957
Description: The OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) is affected by a response body bypass. A client can issue an HTTP Accept header field containing an optional "charset" parameter in order to receive the response in an encoded form. Depending on the "charset", this response can not be decoded by the web application firewall. A restricted resource, access to which would ordinarily be detected, may therefore bypass detection. The legacy CRS versions 3.0.x and 3.1.x are affected, as well as the currently supported versions 3.2.1 and 3.3.2. Integrators and users are advised to upgrade to 3.2.2 and 3.3.3 respectively.

Name: CVE-2022-39956
Description: The OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) is affected by a partial rule set bypass for HTTP multipart requests by submitting a payload that uses a character encoding scheme via the Content-Type or the deprecated Content-Transfer-Encoding multipart MIME header fields that will not be decoded and inspected by the web application firewall engine and the rule set. The multipart payload will therefore bypass detection. A vulnerable backend that supports these encoding schemes can potentially be exploited. The legacy CRS versions 3.0.x and 3.1.x are affected, as well as the currently supported versions 3.2.1 and 3.3.2. Integrators and users are advised upgrade to 3.2.2 and 3.3.3 respectively. The mitigation against these vulnerabilities depends on the installation of the latest ModSecurity version (v2.9.6 / v3.0.8).

Name: CVE-2022-39955
Description: The OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) is affected by a partial rule set bypass by submitting a specially crafted HTTP Content-Type header field that indicates multiple character encoding schemes. A vulnerable back-end can potentially be exploited by declaring multiple Content-Type "charset" names and therefore bypassing the configurable CRS Content-Type header "charset" allow list. An encoded payload can bypass CRS detection this way and may then be decoded by the backend. The legacy CRS versions 3.0.x and 3.1.x are affected, as well as the currently supported versions 3.2.1 and 3.3.2. Integrators and users are advised to upgrade to 3.2.2 and 3.3.3 respectively.

Name: CVE-2022-3982
Description: The Booking calendar, Appointment Booking System WordPress plugin before 3.2.2 does not validate uploaded files, which could allow unauthenticated users to upload arbitrary files, such as PHP and achieve RCE

Name: CVE-2022-39299
Description: Passport-SAML is a SAML 2.0 authentication provider for Passport, the Node.js authentication library. A remote attacker may be able to bypass SAML authentication on a website using passport-saml. A successful attack requires that the attacker is in possession of an arbitrary IDP signed XML element. Depending on the IDP used, fully unauthenticated attacks (e.g without access to a valid user) might also be feasible if generation of a signed message can be triggered. Users should upgrade to passport-saml version 3.2.2 or newer. The issue was also present in the beta releases of `node-saml` before version 4.0.0-beta.5. If you cannot upgrade, disabling SAML authentication may be done as a workaround.

Name: CVE-2022-37787
Description: An issue was discovered in WeCube platform 3.2.2. A DOM XSS vulnerability has been found on the plugin database execution page.

Name: CVE-2022-37786

Name: CVE-2022-37785
Description: An issue was discovered in WeCube Platform 3.2.2. Cleartext passwords are displayed in the configuration for terminal plugins.

Name: CVE-2022-32290
Description: The client in Northern.tech Mender 3.2.0, 3.2.1, and 3.2.2 has Incorrect Access Control. It listens on a random, unprivileged TCP port and exposes an HTTP proxy to facilitate API calls from additional client components running on the device. However, it listens on all network interfaces instead of only the localhost interface. Therefore, any client on the same network can connect to this TCP port and send HTTP requests. The Mender Client will forward these requests to the Mender Server. Additionally, if mTLS is set up, the Mender Client will connect to the Mender Server using the device's client certificate, making it possible for the attacker to bypass mTLS authentication and send requests to the Mender Server without direct access to the client certificate and related private key. Accessing the HTTP proxy from the local network doesn't represent a direct threat, because it doesn't expose any device or server-specific data. However, it increases the attack surface and can be a potential vector to exploit other vulnerabilities both on the Client and the Server.

Name: CVE-2022-30305
Description: An insufficient logging [CWE-778] vulnerability in FortiSandbox versions 4.0.0 to 4.0.2, 3.2.0 to 3.2.3 and 3.1.0 to 3.1.5 and FortiDeceptor versions 4.2.0, 4.1.0 through 4.1.1, 4.0.0 through 4.0.2, 3.3.0 through 3.3.3, 3.2.0 through 3.2.2,3.1.0 through 3.1.1 and 3.0.0 through 3.0.2 may allow a remote attacker to repeatedly enter incorrect credentials without causing a log entry, and with no limit on the number of failed authentication attempts.

Name: CVE-2022-2983

Name: CVE-2022-29556
Description: The iot-manager microservice 1.0.0 in Northern.tech Mender Enterprise before 3.2.2 allows SSRF because the Azure IoT Hub integration provides several SSRF primitives that can execute cross-tenant actions via internal API endpoints.

Name: CVE-2022-29555
Description: The Deviceconnect microservice through 1.3.0 in Northern.tech Mender Enterprise before 3.2.2. allows Cross-Origin Websocket Hijacking.

Name: CVE-2022-29224
Description: Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance proxy. Versions of envoy prior to 1.22.1 are subject to a segmentation fault in the GrpcHealthCheckerImpl. Envoy can perform various types of upstream health checking. One of them uses gRPC. Envoy also has a feature which can &#8220;hold&#8221; (prevent removal) upstream hosts obtained via service discovery until configured active health checking fails. If an attacker controls an upstream host and also controls service discovery of that host (via DNS, the EDS API, etc.), an attacker can crash Envoy by forcing removal of the host from service discovery, and then failing the gRPC health check request. This will crash Envoy via a null pointer dereference. Users are advised to upgrade to resolve this vulnerability. Users unable to upgrade may disable gRPC health checking and/or replace it with a different health checking type as a mitigation.

Name: CVE-2022-25265
Description: In the Linux kernel through 5.16.10, certain binary files may have the exec-all attribute if they were built in approximately 2003 (e.g., with GCC 3.2.2 and Linux kernel 2.4.20). This can cause execution of bytes located in supposedly non-executable regions of a file.

Name: CVE-2022-25168
Description: Apache Hadoop's FileUtil.unTar(File, File) API does not escape the input file name before being passed to the shell. An attacker can inject arbitrary commands. This is only used in Hadoop 3.3 InMemoryAliasMap.completeBootstrapTransfer, which is only ever run by a local user. It has been used in Hadoop 2.x for yarn localization, which does enable remote code execution. It is used in Apache Spark, from the SQL command ADD ARCHIVE. As the ADD ARCHIVE command adds new binaries to the classpath, being able to execute shell scripts does not confer new permissions to the caller. SPARK-38305. "Check existence of file before untarring/zipping", which is included in 3.3.0, 3.1.4, 3.2.2, prevents shell commands being executed, regardless of which version of the hadoop libraries are in use. Users should upgrade to Apache Hadoop 2.10.2, 3.2.4, 3.3.3 or upper (including HADOOP-18136).

Name: CVE-2022-24838
Description: Nextcloud Calendar is a calendar application for the nextcloud framework. SMTP Command Injection in Appointment Emails via Newlines: as newlines and special characters are not sanitized in the email value in the JSON request, a malicious attacker can inject newlines to break out of the `RCPT TO:<BOOKING USER'S EMAIL> ` SMTP command and begin injecting arbitrary SMTP commands. It is recommended that Calendar is upgraded to 3.2.2. There are no workaround available.

Name: CVE-2022-24777
Description: grpc-swift is the Swift language implementation of gRPC, a remote procedure call (RPC) framework. Prior to version 1.7.2, a grpc-swift server is vulnerable to a denial of service attack via a reachable assertion. This is due to incorrect logic when handling GOAWAY frames. The attack is low-effort: it takes very little resources to construct and send the required sequence of frames. The impact on availability is high as the server will crash, dropping all in flight connections and requests. This issue is fixed in version 1.7.2. There are currently no known workarounds.

Name: CVE-2022-24706
Description: In Apache CouchDB prior to 3.2.2, an attacker can access an improperly secured default installation without authenticating and gain admin privileges. The CouchDB documentation has always made recommendations for properly securing an installation, including recommending using a firewall in front of all CouchDB installations.

Name: CVE-2022-23378
Description: A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists within the 3.2.2 version of TastyIgniter. The "items%5B0%5D%5Bpath%5D" parameter of a request made to /admin/allergens/edit/1 is vulnerable.

Name: CVE-2022-22963
Description: In Spring Cloud Function versions 3.1.6, 3.2.2 and older unsupported versions, when using routing functionality it is possible for a user to provide a specially crafted SpEL as a routing-expression that may result in remote code execution and access to local resources.

Name: CVE-2022-22215
Description: A Missing Release of File Descriptor or Handle after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in plugable authentication module (PAM) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a locally authenticated attacker with low privileges to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). It is possible that after the termination of a gRPC connection the respective/var/run/<pid>.env file is not getting deleted which if occurring repeatedly can cause inode exhaustion. Inode exhaustion can present itself in two different ways: 1. The following log message can be observed: host kernel: pid <pid> (<process>), uid <uid> inumber <number> on /.mount/var: out of inodes which by itself is a clear indication. 2. The following log message can be observed: host <process>[<pid>]: ... : No space left on device which is not deterministic and just a representation of a write error which could have several reasons. So the following check needs to be done: user@host> show system storage no-forwarding Filesystem Size Used Avail Capacity Mounted on /dev/ada1p1 475M 300M 137M 69% /.mount/var which indicates that the write error is not actually due to a lack of disk space. If either 1. or 2. has been confirmed, then the output of: user@host> file list /var/run/*.env | count need to be checked and if it indicates a high (>10000) number of files the system has been affected by this issue. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS All versions prior to 19.1R3-S8; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R3-S6; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S5; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R2-S6, 19.4R3-S7; 20.1 version 20.1R1 and later versions; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S5; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S4; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R2. Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved All versions prior to 20.4R3-EVO; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S1-EVO; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R1-S1-EVO, 21.2R2-EVO.

Name: CVE-2022-21189
Description: The package dexie before 3.2.2, from 4.0.0-alpha.1 and before 4.0.0-alpha.3 are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution in the Dexie.setByKeyPath(obj, keyPath, value) function which does not properly check the keys being set (like __proto__ or constructor). This can allow an attacker to add/modify properties of the Object.prototype leading to prototype pollution vulnerability. **Note:** This vulnerability can occur in multiple ways, for example when modifying a collection with untrusted user input.

Name: CVE-2022-0948

Description: The Nimble Page Builder WordPress plugin before 3.2.2 does not sanitise and escape the preview-level-guid parameter before outputting it back in the page, leading to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting

Name: CVE-2021-4407
Description: The Custom Banners plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.2.2 This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the saveCustomFields() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to save custom fields via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

Name: CVE-2021-43138
Description: In Async before 2.6.4 and 3.x before 3.2.2, a malicious user can obtain privileges via the mapValues() method, aka lib/internal/iterator.js createObjectIterator prototype pollution.

Name: CVE-2021-41130
Description: Extensible Service Proxy, a.k.a. ESP is a proxy which enables API management capabilities for JSON/REST or gRPC API services. ESPv1 can be configured to authenticate a JWT token. Its verified JWT claim is passed to the application by HTTP header "X-Endpoint-API-UserInfo", the application can use it to do authorization. But if there are two "X-Endpoint-API-UserInfo" headers from the client, ESPv1 only replaces the first one, the 2nd one will be passed to the application. An attacker can send two "X-Endpoint-API-UserInfo" headers, the second one with a fake JWT claim. Application may use the fake JWT claim to do the authorization. This impacts following ESPv1 usages: 1) Users have configured ESPv1 to do JWT authentication with Google ID Token as described in the referenced google endpoint document. 2) Users backend application is using the info in the "X-Endpoint-API-UserInfo" header to do the authorization. It has been fixed by v1.58.0. You need to patch it in the following ways: * If your docker image is using tag ":1", needs to re-start the container to pick up the new version. The tag ":1" will automatically point to the latest version. * If your docker image tag pings to a specific minor version, e.g. ":1.57". You need to update it to ":1.58" and re-start the container. There are no workaround for this issue.

Name: CVE-2021-33036
Description: In Apache Hadoop 2.2.0 to 2.10.1, 3.0.0-alpha1 to 3.1.4, 3.2.0 to 3.2.2, and 3.3.0 to 3.3.1, a user who can escalate to yarn user can possibly run arbitrary commands as root user. Users should upgrade to Apache Hadoop 2.10.2, 3.2.3, 3.3.2 or higher.

Name: CVE-2021-32805
Description: Flask-AppBuilder is an application development framework, built on top of Flask. In affected versions if using Flask-AppBuilder OAuth, an attacker can share a carefully crafted URL with a trusted domain for an application built with Flask-AppBuilder, this URL can redirect a user to a malicious site. This is an open redirect vulnerability. To resolve this issue upgrade to Flask-AppBuilder 3.2.2 or above. If upgrading is infeasible users may filter HTTP traffic containing `?next={next-site}` where the `next-site` domain is different from the application you are protecting as a workaround.

Name: CVE-2021-32804
Description: The npm package "tar" (aka node-tar) before versions 6.1.1, 5.0.6, 4.4.14, and 3.3.2 has a arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite vulnerability due to insufficient absolute path sanitization. node-tar aims to prevent extraction of absolute file paths by turning absolute paths into relative paths when the `preservePaths` flag is not set to `true`. This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example `/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into `home/user/.bashrc`. This logic was insufficient when file paths contained repeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node-tar` would only strip a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute file path with repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. `///home/user/.bashrc`) would still resolve to an absolute path, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.2, 4.4.14, 5.0.6 and 6.1.1. Users may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom `onentry` method which sanitizes the `entry.path` or a `filter` method which removes entries with absolute paths. See referenced GitHub Advisory for details. Be aware of CVE-2021-32803 which fixes a similar bug in later versions of tar.

Name: CVE-2021-32781
Description: Envoy is an open source L7 proxy and communication bus designed for large modern service oriented architectures. In affected versions after Envoy sends a locally generated response it must stop further processing of request or response data. However when local response is generated due the internal buffer overflow while request or response is processed by the filter chain the operation may not be stopped completely and result in accessing a freed memory block. A specifically constructed request delivered by an untrusted downstream or upstream peer in the presence of extensions that modify and increase the size of request or response bodies resulting in a Denial of Service when using extensions that modify and increase the size of request or response bodies, such as decompressor filter. Envoy versions 1.19.1, 1.18.4, 1.17.4, 1.16.5 contain fixes to address incomplete termination of request processing after locally generated response. As a workaround disable Envoy's decompressor, json-transcoder or grpc-web extensions or proprietary extensions that modify and increase the size of request or response bodies, if feasible.

Name: CVE-2021-32052
Description: In Django 2.2 before 2.2.22, 3.1 before 3.1.10, and 3.2 before 3.2.2 (with Python 3.9.5+), URLValidator does not prohibit newlines and tabs (unless the URLField form field is used). If an application uses values with newlines in an HTTP response, header injection can occur. Django itself is unaffected because HttpResponse prohibits newlines in HTTP headers.

Name: CVE-2021-31826
Description: Shibboleth Service Provider 3.x before 3.2.2 is prone to a NULL pointer dereference flaw involving the session recovery feature. The flaw is exploitable (for a daemon crash) on systems not using this feature if a crafted cookie is supplied.

Name: CVE-2021-31350
Description: An Improper Privilege Management vulnerability in the gRPC framework, used by the Juniper Extension Toolkit (JET) API on Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved, allows a network-based, low-privileged authenticated attacker to perform operations as root, leading to complete compromise of the targeted system.

Name: CVE-2021-21409
Description: Netty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients. In Netty (io.netty:netty-codec-http2) before version 4.1.61.Final there is a vulnerability that enables request smuggling. The content-length header is not correctly validated if the request only uses a single Http2HeaderFrame with the endStream set to to true. This could lead to request smuggling if the request is proxied to a remote peer and translated to HTTP/1.1. This is a followup of GHSA-wm47-8v5p-wjpj/CVE-2021-21295 which did miss to fix this one case. This was fixed as part of 4.1.61.Final.

Name: CVE-2021-21295
Description: Netty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients. In Netty (io.netty:netty-codec-http2) before version 4.1.60.Final there is a vulnerability that enables request smuggling. If a Content-Length header is present in the original HTTP/2 request, the field is not validated by `Http2MultiplexHandler` as it is propagated up. This is fine as long as the request is not proxied through as HTTP/1.1. If the request comes in as an HTTP/2 stream, gets converted into the HTTP/1.1 domain objects (`HttpRequest`, `HttpContent`, etc.) via `Http2StreamFrameToHttpObjectCodec `and then sent up to the child channel's pipeline and proxied through a remote peer as HTTP/1.1 this may result in request smuggling. In a proxy case, users may assume the content-length is validated somehow, which is not the case. If the request is forwarded to a backend channel that is a HTTP/1.1 connection, the Content-Length now has meaning and needs to be checked. An attacker can smuggle requests inside the body as it gets downgraded from HTTP/2 to HTTP/1.1. For an example attack refer to the linked GitHub Advisory. Users are only affected if all of this is true: `HTTP2MultiplexCodec` or `Http2FrameCodec` is used, `Http2StreamFrameToHttpObjectCodec` is used to convert to HTTP/1.1 objects, and these HTTP/1.1 objects are forwarded to another remote peer. This has been patched in 4.1.60.Final As a workaround, the user can do the validation by themselves by implementing a custom `ChannelInboundHandler` that is put in the `ChannelPipeline` behind `Http2StreamFrameToHttpObjectCodec`.

Name: CVE-2021-21290
Description: Netty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients. In Netty before version 4.1.59.Final there is a vulnerability on Unix-like systems involving an insecure temp file. When netty's multipart decoders are used local information disclosure can occur via the local system temporary directory if temporary storing uploads on the disk is enabled. On unix-like systems, the temporary directory is shared between all user. As such, writing to this directory using APIs that do not explicitly set the file/directory permissions can lead to information disclosure. Of note, this does not impact modern MacOS Operating Systems. The method "File.createTempFile" on unix-like systems creates a random file, but, by default will create this file with the permissions "-rw-r--r--". Thus, if sensitive information is written to this file, other local users can read this information. This is the case in netty's "AbstractDiskHttpData" is vulnerable. This has been fixed in version 4.1.59.Final. As a workaround, one may specify your own "java.io.tmpdir" when you start the JVM or use "DefaultHttpDataFactory.setBaseDir(...)" to set the directory to something that is only readable by the current user.

Name: CVE-2017-15708
Description: In Apache Synapse, by default no authentication is required for Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI). So Apache Synapse 3.0.1 or all previous releases (3.0.0, 2.1.0, 2.0.0, 1.2, 1.1.2, 1.1.1) allows remote code execution attacks that can be performed by injecting specially crafted serialized objects. And the presence of Apache Commons Collections 3.2.1 (commons-collections-3.2.1.jar) or previous versions in Synapse distribution makes this exploitable. To mitigate the issue, we need to limit RMI access to trusted users only. Further upgrading to 3.0.1 version will eliminate the risk of having said Commons Collection version. In Synapse 3.0.1, Commons Collection has been updated to 3.2.2 version.

Name: CVE-2024-37293
Description: The AWS Deployment Framework (ADF) is a framework to manage and deploy resources across multiple AWS accounts and regions within an AWS Organization. ADF allows for staged, parallel, multi-account, cross-region deployments of applications or resources via the structure defined in AWS Organizations while taking advantage of services such as AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CodeCommit to alleviate the heavy lifting and management compared to a traditional CI/CD setup. ADF contains a bootstrap process that is responsible to deploy ADF's bootstrap stacks to facilitate multi-account cross-region deployments. The ADF bootstrap process relies on elevated privileges to perform this task. Two versions of the bootstrap process exist; a code-change driven pipeline using AWS CodeBuild and an event-driven state machine using AWS Lambda. If an actor has permissions to change the behavior of the CodeBuild project or the Lambda function, they would be able to escalate their privileges. Prior to version 4.0.0, the bootstrap CodeBuild role provides access to the `sts:AssumeRole` operation without further restrictions. Therefore, it is able to assume into any AWS Account in the AWS Organization with the elevated privileges provided by the cross-account access role. By default, this role is not restricted when it is created by AWS Organizations, providing Administrator level access to the AWS resources in the AWS Account. The patches for this issue are included in `aws-deployment-framework` version 4.0.0. As a temporary mitigation, add a permissions boundary to the roles created by ADF in the management account. The permissions boundary should deny all IAM and STS actions. This permissions boundary should be in place until you upgrade ADF or bootstrap a new account. While the permissions boundary is in place, the account management and bootstrapping of accounts are unable to create, update, or assume into roles. This mitigates the privilege escalation risk, but also disables ADF's ability to create, manage, and bootstrap accounts.

As such, without additional validation steps, the default configuration allows a malicious actor to re-sign an XML document, place the certificate in a `<KeyInfo />` element, and pass `xml-crypto` default validation checks. As a result `xml-crypto` trusts by default any certificate provided via digitally signed XML document's `<KeyInfo />`. `xml-crypto` prefers to use any certificate provided via digitally signed XML document's `<KeyInfo />` even if library was configured to use specific certificate (`publicCert`) for signature verification purposes. An attacker can spoof signature verification by modifying XML document and replacing existing signature with signature generated with malicious private key (created by attacker) and by attaching that private key's certificate to `<KeyInfo />` element. This vulnerability is combination of changes introduced to `4.0.0` on pull request 301 / commit `c2b83f98` and has been addressed in version 6.0.0 with pull request 445 / commit `21201723d`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may either check the certificate extracted via `getCertFromKeyInfo` against trusted certificates before accepting the results of the validation or set `xml-crypto's getCertFromKeyInfo` to `() => undefined` forcing `xml-crypto` to use an explicitly configured `publicCert` or `privateKey` for signature verification.

Name: CVE-2023-44401
Description: The Silverstripe CMS GraphQL Server serves Silverstripe data as GraphQL representations. In versions 4.0.0 prior to 4.3.7 and 5.0.0 prior to 5.1.3, `canView` permission checks are bypassed for ORM data in paginated GraphQL query results where the total number of records is greater than the number of records per page. Note that this also affects GraphQL queries which have a limit applied, even if the query isn&#8217;t paginated per se. This has been fixed in versions 4.3.7 and 5.1.3 by ensuring no new records are pulled in from the database after performing `canView` permission checks for each page of results. This may result in some pages in the query results having less than the maximum number of records per page even when there are more pages of results. This behavior is consistent with how pagination works in other areas of Silverstripe CMS, such as in `GridField`, and is a result of having to perform permission checks in PHP rather than in the database directly. One may disable these permission checks by disabling the `CanViewPermission` plugin.

Description: OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract development. Starting in version 4.0.0 and prior to version 4.9.3, contracts using `ERC2771Context` along with a custom trusted forwarder may see `_msgSender` return `address(0)` in calls that originate from the forwarder with calldata shorter than 20 bytes. This combination of circumstances does not appear to be common, in particular it is not the case for `MinimalForwarder` from OpenZeppelin Contracts, or any deployed forwarder the team is aware of, given that the signer address is appended to all calls that originate from these forwarders. The problem has been patched in v4.9.3.

Name: CVE-2023-38691
Description: matrix-appservice-bridge provides an API for setting up bridges. Starting in version 4.0.0 and prior to versions 8.1.2 and 9.0.1, a malicious Matrix server can use a foreign user's MXID in an OpenID exchange, allowing a bad actor to impersonate users when using the provisioning API. The library does not check that the servername part of the `sub` parameter (containing the user's *claimed* MXID) is the the same as the servername we are talking to. A malicious actor could spin up a server on any given domain, respond with a `sub` parameter according to the user they want to act as and use the resulting token to perform provisioning requests. Versions 8.1.2 and 9.0.1 contain a patch. As a workaround, disable the provisioning API.

Name: CVE-2023-35701
Description: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') vulnerability in Apache Hive. The vulnerability affects the Hive JDBC driver component and it can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution on the machine/endpoint that the JDBC driver (client) is running. The malicious user must have sufficient permissions to specify/edit JDBC URL(s) in an endpoint relying on the Hive JDBC driver and the JDBC client process must run under a privileged user to fully exploit the vulnerability. The attacker can setup a malicious HTTP server and specify a JDBC URL pointing towards this server. When a JDBC connection is attempted, the malicious HTTP server can provide a special response with customized payload that can trigger the execution of certain commands in the JDBC client.This issue affects Apache Hive: from 4.0.0-alpha-1 before 4.0.0. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.0.0, which fixes the issue.

Name: CVE-2023-28635
Description: vantage6 is privacy preserving federated learning infrastructure. Prior to version 4.0.0, malicious users may try to get access to resources they are not allowed to see, by creating resources with integers as names. One example where this is a risk, is when users define which users are allowed to run algorithms on their node. This may be defined by username or user id. Now, for example, if user id 13 is allowed to run tasks, and an attacker creates a username with username '13', they would be wrongly allowed to run an algorithm. There may also be other places in the code where such a mixup of resource ID or name leads to issues. Version 4.0.0 contains a patch for this issue. The best solution is to check when resources are created or modified, that the resource name always starts with a character.

Name: CVE-2022-41923
Description: Grails Spring Security Core plugin is vulnerable to privilege escalation. The vulnerability allows an attacker access to one endpoint (i.e. the targeted endpoint) using the authorization requirements of a different endpoint (i.e. the donor endpoint). In some Grails framework applications, access to the targeted endpoint will be granted based on meeting the authorization requirements of the donor endpoint, which can result in a privilege escalation attack. This vulnerability has been patched in grails-spring-security-core versions 3.3.2, 4.0.5 and 5.1.1. Impacted Applications: Grails Spring Security Core plugin versions: 1.x 2.x >=3.0.0 <3.3.2 >=4.0.0 <4.0.5 >=5.0.0 <5.1.1 We strongly suggest that all Grails framework applications using the Grails Spring Security Core plugin be updated to a patched release of the plugin. Workarounds: Users should create a subclass extending one of the following classes from the `grails.plugin.springsecurity.web.access.intercept` package, depending on their security configuration: * `AnnotationFilterInvocationDefinition` * `InterceptUrlMapFilterInvocationDefinition` * `RequestmapFilterInvocationDefinition` In each case, the subclass should override the `calculateUri` method like so: ``` @Override protected String calculateUri(HttpServletRequest request) { UrlPathHelper.defaultInstance.getRequestUri(request) } ``` This should be considered a temporary measure, as the patched versions of grails-spring-security-core deprecates the `calculateUri` method. Once upgraded to a patched version of the plugin, this workaround is no longer needed. The workaround is especially important for version 2.x, as no patch is available version 2.x of the GSSC plugin.

Name: CVE-2022-31170
Description: OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for smart contract development. Versions 4.0.0 until 4.7.1 are vulnerable to ERC165Checker reverting instead of returning `false`. `ERC165Checker.supportsInterface` is designed to always successfully return a boolean, and under no circumstance revert. However, an incorrect assumption about Solidity 0.8's `abi.decode` allows some cases to revert, given a target contract that doesn't implement EIP-165 as expected, specifically if it returns a value other than 0 or 1. The contracts that may be affected are those that use `ERC165Checker` to check for support for an interface and then handle the lack of support in a way other than reverting. The issue was patched in version 4.7.1.

When using HttpCache, the values of the X-Forwarded-Host headers are implicitly set as trusted while this should be forbidden, leading to potential host header injection.

Name: CVE-2018-14773
Description: An issue was discovered in Http Foundation in Symfony 2.7.0 through 2.7.48, 2.8.0 through 2.8.43, 3.3.0 through 3.3.17, 3.4.0 through 3.4.13, 4.0.0 through 4.0.13, and 4.1.0 through 4.1.2. It arises from support for a (legacy) IIS header that lets users override the path in the request URL via the X-Original-URL or X-Rewrite-URL HTTP request header. These headers are designed for IIS support, but it's not verified that the server is in fact running IIS, which means anybody who can send these requests to an application can trigger this. This affects \Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request::prepareRequestUri() where X-Original-URL and X_REWRITE_URL are both used. The fix drops support for these methods so that they cannot be used as attack vectors such as web cache poisoning.

Name: CVE-2024-31996
Description: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in version 3.0.1 and prior to versions 4.10.19, 15.5.4, and 15.10-rc-1, the HTML escaping of escaping tool that is used in XWiki doesn't escape `{`, which, when used in certain places, allows XWiki syntax injection and thereby remote code execution. The vulnerability has been fixed in XWiki 14.10.19, 15.5.5, and 15.9 RC1. Apart from upgrading, there is no generic workaround. However, replacing `$escapetool.html` by `$escapetool.xml` in XWiki documents fixes the vulnerability. In a standard XWiki installation, the maintainers are only aware of the document `Panels.PanelLayoutUpdate` that exposes this vulnerability, patching this document is thus a workaround. Any extension could expose this vulnerability and might thus require patching, too.

Name: CVE-2023-25172
Description: Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version 3.0.1 of the `stable` branch and version 3.1.0.beta2 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, a maliciously crafted URL can be included in a user's full name field to to carry out cross-site scripting attacks on sites with a disabled or overly permissive CSP (Content Security Policy). Discourse's default CSP prevents this vulnerability. The vulnerability is patched in version 3.0.1 of the `stable` branch and version 3.1.0.beta2 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches. As a workaround, enable and/or restore your site's CSP to the default one provided with Discourse.

Description: formula is a math and string formula parser. In versions prior to 3.0.1 crafted user-provided strings to formula's parser might lead to polynomial execution time and a denial of service. Users should upgrade to 3.0.1+. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

Name: CVE-2023-23984
Description: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Wow-Company Bubble Menu &#8211; circle floating menu plugin <= 3.0.1 leading to form deletion.

Name: CVE-2023-23935
Description: Discourse is an open-source messaging platform. In versions 3.0.1 and prior on the `stable` branch and versions 3.1.0.beta2 and prior on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, the count of personal messages displayed for a tag is a count of all personal messages regardless of whether the personal message is visible to a given user. As a result, any users can technically poll a sensitive tag to determine if a new personal message is created even if the user does not have access to the personal message. In the patched versions, the count of personal messages tagged with a given tag is hidden by default. To revert to the old behaviour of displaying the count of personal messages for a given tag, an admin may enable the `display_personal_messages_tag_counts` site setting.

Name: CVE-2023-23883
Description: Auth. (admin+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in David Gwyer WP Content Filter plugin <= 3.0.1 versions.

Name: CVE-2023-23624
Description: Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version 3.0.1 on the `stable` branch and version 3.1.0.beta2 on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, someone can use the `exclude_tag param` to filter out topics and deduce which ones were using a specific hidden tag. This affects any Discourse site using hidden tags in public categories. This issue is patched in version 3.0.1 on the `stable` branch and version 3.1.0.beta2 on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches. As a workaround, secure any categories that are using hidden tags, change any existing hidden tags to not include private data, or remove any hidden tags currently in use.

Name: CVE-2023-23622
Description: Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version 3.0.1 of the `stable` branch and version 3.1.0.beta2 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, the count of topics displayed for a tag is a count of all regular topics regardless of whether the topic is in a read restricted category or not. As a result, any users can technically poll a sensitive tag to determine if a new topic is created in a category which the user does not have excess to. In version 3.0.1 of the `stable` branch and version 3.1.0.beta2 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, the count of topics displayed for a tag defaults to only counting regular topics which are not in read restricted categories. Staff users will continue to see a count of all topics regardless of the topic's category read restrictions.

Name: CVE-2023-23621
Description: Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version 3.0.1 on the `stable` branch and version 3.1.0.beta2 on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, a malicious user can cause a regular expression denial of service using a carefully crafted user agent. This issue is patched in version 3.0.1 on the `stable` branch and version 3.1.0.beta2 on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches. There are no known workarounds.

Name: CVE-2023-23620
Description: Discourse is an open-source discussion platform.

Name: CVE-2023-23616
Description: Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version 3.0.1 on the `stable` branch and 3.1.0.beta2 on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, when submitting a membership request, there is no character limit for the reason provided with the request. This could potentially allow a user to flood the database with a large amount of data. However it is unlikely this could be used as part of a DoS attack, as the paths reading back the reasons are only available to administrators. Starting in version 3.0.1 on the `stable` branch and 3.1.0.beta2 on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, a limit of 280 characters has been introduced for membership requests.

Name: CVE-2023-22739
Description: Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion.

Name: CVE-2022-39382
Description: Keystone is a headless CMS for Node.js &#8212; built with GraphQL and React.`@keystone-6/core@3.0.0 || 3.0.1` users that use `NODE_ENV` to trigger security-sensitive functionality in their production builds are vulnerable to `NODE_ENV` being inlined to `"development"` for user code, irrespective of what your environment variables. If you do not use `NODE_ENV` in your user code to trigger security-sensitive functionality, you are not impacted by this vulnerability. Any dependencies that use `NODE_ENV` to trigger particular behaviors (optimizations, security or otherwise) should still respect your environment's configured `NODE_ENV` variable. The application's dependencies, as found in `node_modules` (including `@keystone-6/core`), are typically not compiled as part of this process, and thus should be unaffected. We have tested this assumption by verifying that `NODE_ENV=production yarn keystone start` still uses secure cookies when using `statelessSessions`. This vulnerability has been fixed in @keystone-6/core@3.0.2, regression tests have been added for this vulnerability in #8063.

Name: CVE-2022-3602
Description: A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service) or potentially remote code execution. Many platforms implement stack overflow protections which would mitigate against the risk of remote code execution. The risk may be further mitigated based on stack layout for any given platform/compiler. Pre-announcements of CVE-2022-3602 described this issue as CRITICAL. Further analysis based on some of the mitigating factors described above have led this to be downgraded to HIGH. Users are still encouraged to upgrade to a new version as soon as possible. In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication and a malicious client connects. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.7 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2,3.0.3,3.0.4,3.0.5,3.0.6).

Name: CVE-2022-34321
Description: Improper Authentication vulnerability in Apache Pulsar Proxy allows an attacker to connect to the /proxy-stats endpoint without authentication. The vulnerable endpoint exposes detailed statistics about live connections, along with the capability to modify the logging level of proxied connections without requiring proper authentication credentials. This issue affects Apache Pulsar versions from 2.6.0 to 2.10.5, from 2.11.0 to 2.11.2, from 3.0.0 to 3.0.1, and 3.1.0. The known risks include exposing sensitive information such as connected client IP and unauthorized logging level manipulation which could lead to a denial-of-service condition by significantly increasing the proxy's logging overhead. When deployed via the Apache Pulsar Helm chart within Kubernetes environments, the actual client IP might not be revealed through the load balancer's default behavior, which typically obscures the original source IP addresses when externalTrafficPolicy is being configured to "Cluster" by default. The /proxy-stats endpoint contains topic level statistics, however, in the default configuration, the topic level statistics aren't known to be exposed. 2.10 Pulsar Proxy users should upgrade to at least 2.10.6. 2.11 Pulsar Proxy users should upgrade to at least 2.11.3. 3.0 Pulsar Proxy users should upgrade to at least 3.0.2. 3.1 Pulsar Proxy users should upgrade to at least 3.1.1. Users operating versions prior to those listed above should upgrade to the aforementioned patched versions or newer versions. Additionally, it's imperative to recognize that the Apache Pulsar Proxy is not intended for direct exposure to the internet. The architectural design of Pulsar Proxy assumes that it will operate within a secured network environment, safeguarded by appropriate perimeter defenses.

Name: CVE-2022-2068
Description: In addition to the c_rehash shell command injection identified in CVE-2022-1292, further circumstances where the c_rehash script does not properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command injection were found by code review. When the CVE-2022-1292 was fixed it was not discovered that there are other places in the script where the file names of certificates being hashed were possibly passed to a command executed through the shell. This script is distributed by some operating systems in a manner where it is automatically executed. On such operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the script. Use of the c_rehash script is considered obsolete and should be replaced by the OpenSSL rehash command line tool. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.4 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2,3.0.3). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1p (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1o). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zf (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2ze).

Name: CVE-2022-1473
Description: The OPENSSL_LH_flush() function, which empties a hash table, contains a bug that breaks reuse of the memory occuppied by the removed hash table entries. This function is used when decoding certificates or keys. If a long lived process periodically decodes certificates or keys its memory usage will expand without bounds and the process might be terminated by the operating system causing a denial of service. Also traversing the empty hash table entries will take increasingly more time. Typically such long lived processes might be TLS clients or TLS servers configured to accept client certificate authentication. The function was added in the OpenSSL 3.0 version thus older releases are not affected by the issue. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.3 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2).

Name: CVE-2022-1434
Description: The OpenSSL 3.0 implementation of the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite incorrectly uses the AAD data as the MAC key. This makes the MAC key trivially predictable. An attacker could exploit this issue by performing a man-in-the-middle attack to modify data being sent from one endpoint to an OpenSSL 3.0 recipient such that the modified data would still pass the MAC integrity check. Note that data sent from an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint to a non-OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint will always be rejected by the recipient and the connection will fail at that point. Many application protocols require data to be sent from the client to the server first. Therefore, in such a case, only an OpenSSL 3.0 server would be impacted when talking to a non-OpenSSL 3.0 client. If both endpoints are OpenSSL 3.0 then the attacker could modify data being sent in both directions. In this case both clients and servers could be affected, regardless of the application protocol. Note that in the absence of an attacker this bug means that an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint communicating with a non-OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint will fail to complete the handshake when using this ciphersuite. The confidentiality of data is not impacted by this issue, i.e. an attacker cannot decrypt data that has been encrypted using this ciphersuite - they can only modify it. In order for this attack to work both endpoints must legitimately negotiate the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite. This ciphersuite is not compiled by default in OpenSSL 3.0, and is not available within the default provider or the default ciphersuite list. This ciphersuite will never be used if TLSv1.3 has been negotiated. In order for an OpenSSL 3.0 endpoint to use this ciphersuite the following must have occurred: 1) OpenSSL must have been compiled with the (non-default) compile time option enable-weak-ssl-ciphers 2) OpenSSL must have had the legacy provider explicitly loaded (either through application code or via configuration) 3) The ciphersuite must have been explicitly added to the ciphersuite list 4) The libssl security level must have been set to 0 (default is 1) 5) A version of SSL/TLS below TLSv1.3 must have been negotiated 6) Both endpoints must negotiate the RC4-MD5 ciphersuite in preference to any others that both endpoints have in common Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.3 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2).

Name: CVE-2022-1343
Description: The function `OCSP_basic_verify` verifies the signer certificate on an OCSP response. In the case where the (non-default) flag OCSP_NOCHECKS is used then the response will be positive (meaning a successful verification) even in the case where the response signing certificate fails to verify. It is anticipated that most users of `OCSP_basic_verify` will not use the OCSP_NOCHECKS flag. In this case the `OCSP_basic_verify` function will return a negative value (indicating a fatal error) in the case of a certificate verification failure. The normal expected return value in this case would be 0. This issue also impacts the command line OpenSSL "ocsp" application. When verifying an ocsp response with the "-no_cert_checks" option the command line application will report that the verification is successful even though it has in fact failed. In this case the incorrect successful response will also be accompanied by error messages showing the failure and contradicting the apparently successful result. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.3 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2).

Name: CVE-2022-1292
Description: The c_rehash script does not properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command injection. This script is distributed by some operating systems in a manner where it is automatically executed. On such operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the script. Use of the c_rehash script is considered obsolete and should be replaced by the OpenSSL rehash command line tool. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.3 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1o (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1n). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2ze (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zd).

Name: CVE-2022-0778
Description: The BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1m). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zd (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zc).

Description: Mbed TLS before 3.0.1 has a double free in certain out-of-memory conditions, as demonstrated by an mbedtls_ssl_set_session() failure.

Name: CVE-2021-4160
Description: There is a carry propagation bug in the MIPS32 and MIPS64 squaring procedure. Many EC algorithms are affected, including some of the TLS 1.3 default curves. Impact was not analyzed in detail, because the pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely and include reusing private keys. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be significant. However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have to share the DH private key among multiple clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1m and 3.0.1 on the 15th of December 2021. For the 1.0.2 release it is addressed in git commit 6fc1aaaf3 that is available to premium support customers only. It will be made available in 1.0.2zc when it is released. The issue only affects OpenSSL on MIPS platforms. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.1 (Affected 3.0.0). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1m (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1l). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zc-dev (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zb).

Name: CVE-2021-4044
Description: Internally libssl in OpenSSL calls X509_verify_cert() on the client side to verify a certificate supplied by a server. That function may return a negative return value to indicate an internal error (for example out of memory). Such a negative return value is mishandled by OpenSSL and will cause an IO function (such as SSL_connect() or SSL_do_handshake()) to not indicate success and a subsequent call to SSL_get_error() to return the value SSL_ERROR_WANT_RETRY_VERIFY. This return value is only supposed to be returned by OpenSSL if the application has previously called SSL_CTX_set_cert_verify_callback(). Since most applications do not do this the SSL_ERROR_WANT_RETRY_VERIFY return value from SSL_get_error() will be totally unexpected and applications may not behave correctly as a result. The exact behaviour will depend on the application but it could result in crashes, infinite loops or other similar incorrect responses. This issue is made more serious in combination with a separate bug in OpenSSL 3.0 that will cause X509_verify_cert() to indicate an internal error when processing a certificate chain. This will occur where a certificate does not include the Subject Alternative Name extension but where a Certificate Authority has enforced name constraints. This issue can occur even with valid chains. By combining the two issues an attacker could induce incorrect, application dependent behaviour. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.1 (Affected 3.0.0).

Name: CVE-2021-4007
Description: Rapid7 Insight Agent, versions 3.0.1 to 3.1.2.34, suffer from a local privilege escalation due to an uncontrolled DLL search path. Specifically, when Insight Agent versions 3.0.1 to 3.1.2.34 start, the Python interpreter attempts to load python3.dll at "C:\DLLs\python3.dll," which normally is writable by locally authenticated users. Because of this, a malicious local user could use Insight Agent's startup conditions to elevate to SYSTEM privileges. This issue was fixed in Rapid7 Insight Agent 3.1.2.35. This vulnerability is a regression of CVE-2019-5629.

Name: CVE-2020-1955
Description: CouchDB version 3.0.0 shipped with a new configuration setting that governs access control to the entire database server called `require_valid_user_except_for_up`. It was meant as an extension to the long standing setting `require_valid_user`, which in turn requires that any and all requests to CouchDB will have to be made with valid credentials, effectively forbidding any anonymous requests. The new `require_valid_user_except_for_up` is an off-by-default setting that was meant to allow requiring valid credentials for all endpoints except for the `/_up` endpoint. However, the implementation of this made an error that lead to not enforcing credentials on any endpoint, when enabled. CouchDB versions 3.0.1[1] and 3.1.0[2] fix this issue.
